# BFS and DFS
## Graph
要理解BFS和DFS，首先要了解graph的概念                          
>圖(graph)是由節點(node)和邊(edge)組合而成的非線性結構，如果我們想要從其中的一個節點開始，走訪到其有直接或是間接連接的其它所有節點,可以依靠深度優先搜尋法(DFS, Depth-first Search)或是廣度優先搜尋法(BFS, Breadth-first Search)來達成。

## BFS-廣度優先搜尋
>Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'[1]), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.              
         
>It uses the opposite strategy as depth-first search, which instead explores the node branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and expand other nodes.
